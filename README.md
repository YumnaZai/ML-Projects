Supervised Learning Algorithms
Linear Regression
📌 Used for: Predicting continuous values
📍 Example: Predicting house prices based on features like size and location

Logistic Regression
📌 Used for: Binary classification
📍 Example: Predicting whether an email is spam or not

Decision Trees
📌 Used for: Classification and regression
📍 Example: Determining if a loan application should be approved based on applicant details

Random Forest
📌 Used for: Ensemble learning for classification/regression
📍 Example: Predicting customer churn in telecom companies

Support Vector Machines (SVM)
📌 Used for: Classification (mainly) and regression
📍 Example: Face detection in images

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
📌 Used for: Classification and regression
📍 Example: Recommending products based on similar customer preferences

Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
📌 Used for: High-performance classification and regression
📍 Example: Predicting credit card fraud

Naive Bayes
📌 Used for: Text classification
📍 Example: Sentiment analysis on customer reviews
