Supervised Learning Algorithms
Linear Regression
- Models Build - > Regression model = Predicting salary of position(Simple Linear Regression)
                                    = Predict student score(Simple Linear Regression)
                                    = Predict petrol cunsumption of a country(Multiple Linear Regression)
=  Randon dataset based on numpy(Polinomial Regression)

Logistic Regression/Classification
- Models Build -> ANN = Indicating "good" or "bad" radar returns(Binary Classification)
                  ANN = predict the price range of mobile phones(Binary Classification)


Decision Trees
📌 Used for: Classification and regression
📍 Example: Determining if a loan application should be approved based on applicant details

Random Forest
📌 Used for: Ensemble learning for classification/regression
📍 Example: Predicting customer churn in telecom companies

Support Vector Machines (SVM)
📌 Used for: Classification (mainly) and regression
📍 Example: Face detection in images

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
📌 Used for: Classification and regression
📍 Example: Recommending products based on similar customer preferences

Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
📌 Used for: High-performance classification and regression
📍 Example: Predicting credit card fraud

Naive Bayes
📌 Used for: Text classification
📍 Example: Sentiment analysis on customer reviews
