Machine Learning Models
ML PROBLEM TYPE

📍 Regression

  📌 Linear Regression
      = Predicting salary of position(Simple Linear Regression)
      = Predict student score(Simple Linear Regression)
      = Predict petrol cunsumption of a country(Multiple Linear Regression)
      = Predicting solubility of molecules(Multiple Linear Regression)
      = Predicting diabetese diagnosis
      
 📌 Decision Trees
    = Diabetese Prediction

 📌 Random Forest
      =  Random Forest = Predicting solubility of molecules

📍 Classification

  📌Logistic Regression
    = Indicating "good" or "bad" radar returns(ANN)
    = Predict the price range of mobile phones(ANN)
    = Twitter Sentiment analysis

   📌 Random Forest
    = Sentiment analysis on customer reviews

   📌Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    Used for: Classification (mainly) and regression
    Example: Face detection in images

   📌 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    Used for: Classification and regression
    Example: Recommending products based on similar customer preferences

   📌 Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
    Used for: High-performance classification and regression
    Example: Predicting credit card fraud

  📌 Naive Bayes
    Used for: Text classification
    = Sentiment analysis on customer reviews
    = Predicting if a message is a spam or ham

   📍Clustering
   - Partition Clustering =  Grouping similar players
   - Hirarchical Clustering =  grouping different merchant offers
