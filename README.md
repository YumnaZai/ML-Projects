    = Predict the price range of mobile phones(ANN)
    = Twitter Sentiment analysis

   📌 Random Forest
    = Sentiment analysis on customer reviews

   📌Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    Used for: Classification (mainly) and regression
    Example: Face detection in images

   📌 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    Used for: Classification and regression
    Example: Recommending products based on similar customer preferences

   📌 Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
    Used for: High-performance classification and regression
    Example: Predicting credit card fraud

  📌 Naive Bayes
    Used for: Text classification
    = Sentiment analysis on customer reviews
